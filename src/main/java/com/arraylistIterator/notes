addAll method use in combine two arraylist
ArrayList <String> ar1 = new Arraylist()
ar1.add("Shubham");
ar1.add("tripathi");
ar1.add("InterraIt");

ArrayList <String> ar2 = new ArrayList<>();
ar2.add(3);
ar2.add("position");

System.out.println(ar1.addAll(ar2);
now two arraylist ar1 and ar2 combined but remember there store type should be same if object the another one
is also object if String then string line no 2 and 7.

Clone method ar.clone(); to clone the same arraylist

Contains method to verify does the arraylist having that vlue in the the list or not. it will give bollean
value with true or false.
ar.contians(100);

indexOf() method give the index number of the Arraylist and if the variable is not there then it will return the -1
if the indexOf() are used with comparable operator then it will give the boolean result similar to contains().

lastindexOf () give the variable position or the index number

removeIf () is boolean statement and can be used in conditional if else see the removeIf () program

sublist() is used to find the element between the element 1,2,3,4,5,5  ar.sublist(2,5); it will give element
