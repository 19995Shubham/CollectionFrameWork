Not follow order
No duplicate key allowed. We can store the value but this will give only latest key value.
Value can be multiple null.
Follow key and value.
only one null value allowed.
If element is not stored and fetch the value then it will return null.
HasMap is not synchronised or not thread safe.
(HasTable is synchronised)
In hashmap we cannot iterate directly we have to use another method to same we can not use for loop
Iterator<> it = referenceVariable.keyset().iterator().   here we use keyset() method to iterate the key.
